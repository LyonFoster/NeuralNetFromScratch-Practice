# NeuralNetFromScratch-Practice
I'm working through the book *Neural Network From Scratch In Python* (nnfs.io). As I go I'll be posting my code here.

## My Goals with this project
- Get better at object oriented programming
- Learn to use different c++ libraries (Eigen, etc.)
- Get better at larger scale math problems in c++
