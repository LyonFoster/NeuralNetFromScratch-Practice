# NeuralNetFromScratch-Practice
I'm working through the book *Neural Network From Scratch In Python* (https://nnfs.io). As I go I'll be posting my code here.

Every chapter is going to have it's own associated functions, headers, etc. My hope is that as I need to use things from previous chapters, I'll re-implememt these concepts the way I *should* have implemented them the first time around and it'll sort of track my learning.

## My Goals with this project
- Get better at object oriented programming
- Learn to use different c++ libraries (Eigen, etc.)
- Get better at larger scale math problems in c++

## Dependencies

I use Eigen (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) for all of the matrix stuff
I normally compile with ```g++ -std=c++17 nnfsMain.cpp path/to/eigen-3.3.7```
